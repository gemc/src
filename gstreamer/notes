gstreamerROOTFactory:

to check the original library location (they may be simlinks)

l $ROOTSYS

example: /usr/local/Cellar/root/6.26.02/lib

 open $ROOTSYS/lib/root
 
	- libCore.so
	- libRIO.so
	- libTree.so

These are symlinks so they should come from the correct place, i.e. /usr/local/Cellar/root/6.24.04/lib


Glibrary:

	goptions
	gstreamer
	gdata
