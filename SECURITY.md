# GEMC Security Policy

**Contact:** gemc@jlab.org  
**Do not open public issues for security bugs.**

## Supported Versions

We provide security fixes for:
- The default branch (next release)

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| dev     | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.0     | :x:                |


## Report a Vulnerability
Email **gemc@jlab.org** with:
- What the issue is and why it matters
- Steps to reproduce (a minimal PoC if possible)
- Affected version / commit and environment

If you prefer to use GitHub’s private reporting (if enabled), use **Security → Report a vulnerability**.

## What to Expect
- We’ll acknowledge your report and start triage as soon as we can.
- We’ll work on a fix and coordinate a release or mitigation.
- We’ll credit you (name or handle) if you want.

## Scope
- In scope: GEMC code in the official repositories and our published container images.
- Out of scope: vulnerabilities that are only in third-party dependencies (please report upstream; you can CC us).

Thanks for helping keep GEMC users safe.
