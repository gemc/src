- add frameworks and libraries by dragging it into "Frameworks" directory.
  * frameworks can be embedded in binary (products destination) to run it on the build, uncheck copy only when installing
  * libraryies can be copied to products destination (no subpath) to run it on the build uncheck copy only when installing

 - if problems with plugin "cocoa":
   * can set QT_DEBUG_PLUGINS to 1 in the env variables for more debugging
   * can set QT_PLUGIN_PATH to plugin locations (cocoa plugin is under platforms there), currently /opt/jlab_software/2.4/Darwin_macosx10.15-clang12.0.0/qt/system/clang_64/plugins

- qtframeworks (qt5, note 6 are different): QtCore, QtGui, QtWidgets, QtOpenGL, QtPrintSupport:

open $QTDIR/lib

- glibrary libs:

open $GLIBRARY/lib/

- clhep: clhep-version.dylib

open $CLHEP_BASE_DIR/lib/

- xerces-c: xerces-c-version.dylib

open $XERCESCROOT/lib/

- geant4: add all libraries

open $G4ROOT/4.10.06.p02MT/lib/

GEMC 3 reminders:

1. set MT option in go_geant4
2. set DG4MULTITHREADED in loadgeant4.py

 Pre-processor
 Found with scons SHOWBUILD=1
 Can paste in one line in Build Settings - preprocessor macro.
 For example G4MULTITHREADED will change the meaning of G4cout (will use G4cout_p instead)

 Code conventions
 - camel case for all variable names, class definitions
 - type definitions start with Capital Letter
 - instances start with lowercase letter
 - shared variables should contain "shared" / "global" in the name
 - thread-local variable should contain "local" / "tlocal" / "thread"
 - source filenames starts with Capital letters << maybe not





Make sure compiler is gnu++17
Make sure frameworks are compiled into dynamic libraries, and each of those should use but not embed their dependencies

## The rule of three:

If you need to explicitly declare either the destructor, copy constructor or copy assignment operator yourself,
you probably need to explicitly declare all three of them.
From C++11 on, an object has 2 extra special member functions: the move constructor and move assignment.
The rule of five states to implement these functions as well.

class person
{
    std::string name;
    int age;

public:
    person(const std::string& name, int age);        // Ctor
    person(const person &) = default;                // 1/5: Copy Ctor
    person(person &&) noexcept = default;            // 4/5: Move Ctor
    person& operator=(const person &) = default;     // 2/5: Copy Assignment
    person& operator=(person &&) noexcept = default; // 5/5: Move Assignment
    ~person() noexcept = default;                    // 3/5: Dtor
};
