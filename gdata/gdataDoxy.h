 *
 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 * The GData library provides classes and utilities to manage hit data,
 * event collections, and frame data for Geant4-based simulations. It
 * supports both true hit information and digitized data, as well as configurable
 * options for detector and electronics parameters.
 *
 * \section modules_sec Modules
 * - GTrueInfoData: Stores true hit data from simulation.
 * - GEventDataCollection: Collects event-level data and associated hit information.
 * - GDigitizedData: Handles digitized data output from the simulation.
 * - GFrameDataCollection: Manages integrated frame-level data.
 *
 * \section usage_sec Usage
 * The library uses modern C++ features such as smart pointers,
 * std::chrono for timestamps, and constexpr constants. See the individual
 * class documentation for further details.
