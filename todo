working on gemc:

- materials
- cad 
- divide source in different libraries like scons (started with gdetector)
- put the verbosity string options into conventions, like GSENSITIVITYVERBOSITY = "gsensitivityv"
- add detector list + interface like gemc2
- add hipo output
- add sro output
- add display goodies like gemc2++



In General:

- keep chasing using namespace;
- when necessary, implement the rule of 5.
- add section "fromScratch" to redo project and targets from scratch in the notes
- go over constructors: is it move, copy, construct from scratch?
- only load env needed by each library, see glibrary todo
- make script to copy necessary library/gcards into xcode builds
- examples/advanced/doiPET/README

Gemc Details:

- catalogue exit codes across libraries: find in project #define EC__
- use gConstruct gDestruct;
- later down the road: compare map vs unordered_map speed and memory usage.
- gopts must be shared ptr so it can be used in the local threads
- account for detector dependencies: for example cadbeamline needs fc
- streamData instead of EventData. How to organize this?
- check examples for new GHitsCollection(sdName, collectionName[0]) in which perhaps there are multiple hit collections and collectionName[1] is used
- if decisionToSkipHit, return true or false? check examples?
