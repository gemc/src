working on gemc:

The following 3 may be solved by inheriting from GStateMessage.
- put the verbosity string options into conventions, like GSENSITIVITYVERBOSITY = "gsensitivity"
- use logMessage (g4) and glogMessage (internam cout with mutex log) consistently
- something not working with tlog / thread_log etc. everything better be consistent
- use G4debug instead?

- nthreads not working?
- add system/detector browser
- add hipo output
- do we need gFieldManager.clearDLMap(); ?
- gext with message (and threadlock) so we don't have to use cerr or G4cerr
- any level of optimization higher than 0 cause some exit failure, gexit misses. why?


In General:

- event reproducibility: write random engine status in output stream
- keep chasing using namespace;
- rule of 5.
- go over constructors: is it move, copy, construct from scratch?
- examples/advanced/doiPET/README
- add display goodies like gemc2++
- standardize log colors


Gemc Details:

- catalogue exit codes across libraries: find in project #define EC__
- use gConstruct gDestruct;
- later down the road: compare map vs unordered_map speed and memory usage.
- gopts must be shared ptr so it can be used in the local threads
- account for detector dependencies: for example cadbeamline needs fc
- streamData instead of EventData. How to organize this?
- check examples for new GHitsCollection(sdName, collectionName[0]) in which perhaps there are multiple hit collections and collectionName[1] is used
- if decisionToSkipHit, return true or false? check examples?
- go over text colors and style in the output
