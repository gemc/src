# Doxygen Documentation for GEMC


## To add a library to the doxygen CI:

- modify ci/doxygen.sh to include the library
- add a <library>Doxy.h header file to describe the library, possibly with:
  - overview
  - conventions
  - examples
  - api
- review headers and code to add proper documentation
