/**
 * \file eventDispenser.cc
 * \brief Implements the EventDispenser class which distributes events among runs.
 *
 * \mainpage Event Dispenser Module
 *
 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 * The Event Dispenser module is responsible for distributing simulation events
 * among different runs based on a userâ€“defined weighting scheme. It reads run weight
 * information from a file (if provided) or uses options provided via GOptions. It then
 * randomly assigns events to runs and executes them using Geant4 commands.
 *
 * \section details_sec Details
 * The module initializes the run weight maps, distributes events randomly based on the weights,
 * and processes events by calling Geant4 UI commands (e.g., /run/beamOn). The class also logs
 * progress and summary information.
 *
 * \section usage_sec Usage
 * To use the EventDispenser, instantiate it with a pointer to GOptions and a global map of
 * GDynamicDigitization plugins. Call processEvents() to run the events.
