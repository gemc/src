# GEMC Community Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We, as members, contributors, and maintainers of GEMC, pledge to make participation 
in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of 
age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, experience level, 
education, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal 
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy and kindness to other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Sexualized language or imagery
- Public or private harassment, or publishing others’ private information
- Sustained disruption of discussions or reviews
- Spam or advertising unrelated to the project

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable 
behavior and may take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior 
they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and also applies when an 
individual is representing the project in public spaces.

## Reporting
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, report it to **gemc@jlab.org**. 
Reports will be reviewed and handled confidentially to the extent possible. 
If the incident involves a maintainer, the project will bring in an uninvolved reviewer.

## Enforcement
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. 
Maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### Enforcement Guidelines
- **Correction** — For minor, one-off issues. Consequence: private or public clarification of expectations.
- **Warning** — For a single significant incident or repeated minor issues. Consequence: written warning and expectations for change.
- **Temporary Restriction** — For repeated violations. Consequence: temporary removal from interactions (issues, PRs, etc.).
- **Permanent Ban** — For severe or repeated violations. Consequence: permanent removal from community spaces.
